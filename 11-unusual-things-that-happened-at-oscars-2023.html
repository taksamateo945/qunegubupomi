Here is the list of our 11 unusual things that happened at Oscars 2023.</p><p>Did you watch the Oscars 2023? Let us know in the comments down below.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Oscars-2023-1024x536.webp><h2 class="kt-adv-heading_363431-ae wp-block-kadence-advancedheading" data-kb-block=kb-adv-heading_363431-ae>Jessica Chastain wearing a Mask</h2><p>The Oscars are among the crowdiest places as hundreds of celebrities are present. And covid is still unfinished, so Jessica has decided to be more cautious.</p><p>She was the only guest to wear a mask at Oscars 2023. Although, she did open her mask at one point when the host <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jimmy Kimmel</a> asked her a question during an audience participation segment.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Jessica-Chastain-at-Oscars-jpg.webp><p>You might be wondering why she is wearing a mask. Well, covid safety is the first thing, but Jessica is being extra safe now as she is starring on broadway in the play A Doll’s house, which opened recently. Viewers praised her on social media, and users supported them by saying,</p><p>” So grateful that Jessica Chastain is wearing a mask at the Oscars. Thanks for keeping Covid precautions visible, especially at a super spreader event promoting going to Movies in person.” #Oscar #wearamask</p><h2 class="kt-adv-heading_908960-12 wp-block-kadence-advancedheading" data-kb-block=kb-adv-heading_908960-12>Ukraine support</h2><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Volodymyr Zelenskyy</a> is a Ukrainian politician, former comedian, and actor who has served as Ukraine’s sixth and current president since 2019. Zelensky has been greeted with open arms by award shows, film festivals, and even the New York Stock Exchange for years.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Volodymyr-Zelenskyy-Ukraine-President-jpg.webp><p>Still, when it comes to landing airtime on the most important telecast of all, the Oscars, the Ukrainian leader is being met with a cold shoulder. For the second year in a row, the Oscars 2023 has snubbed Zelenskyy, hoping to follow up his Berlin film festival remote appearance last month with a virtual spot on Sunday’s Oscars telecast on ABC.</p><p>Sources say WME power agent Mike Simpson made a plea to the Academy to include him but was shut down. The Academy declined to comment, but Zelenskyy wanted to speak to the nation at the Oscars due to polls showing American Support for assisting Ukraine has weakened.</p><h2 class="kt-adv-heading_f8261a-30 wp-block-kadence-advancedheading" data-kb-block=kb-adv-heading_f8261a-30>Hugh Grant’s rude interview</h2><p>The interaction between <a href=#>Hugh Grant</a> and the interviewer, Ashley Graham, was another event highlight of Oscars 2023. However, what caught everyone’s attention was how worn out, and unenthusiastic was the answer of the British actor.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Hugh-Grants-rude-interview-at-the-Academy-Awards-jpg.webp><p>Some even said Grant was rude to the interviewer even though he answered every question.</p><h2 class="kt-adv-heading_8213c4-41 wp-block-kadence-advancedheading" data-kb-block=kb-adv-heading_8213c4-41>Elvis is snubbed</h2><p>The 2022 biographical drama based on Rock and Roll King, <a href=# data-type=post data-id=18544>Elvis Presley</a>, generally received positive reviews, with Austin Butler’s performance gardening widespread acclaim. The cinematography editing, sound design, costume design, production design, and musical sequences also received praise.</p><p>The American film institute named Elvis one of the ten best films of 2022, and it was nominated for eight awards at the 95th Academy Awards but won nothing. Three of these nominations were for Catherine Martin in the picture, production design, and costume design.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Austin-Butler-at-the-95th-academy-awards-jpg.webp><p>It also looked like <a href=#>Austin Butler</a> might have taken home lead actor after his BAFTA win, but Brendan Fraser ultimately won Oscars 2023 for his comeback role in The Whale.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Malala being asked about Spitgate</h2><p>For those who don’t know, Spitgate is an incident between Harry Styles and Chris Pine, the film’s costars, Don’t worry Darling, where Harry spit on Chris at the Venice Film Festival. The internet went wild over it in September after a video was posted of it.</p><p>Chris said the story was ridiculous, a complete fabrication, resulting from an odd online allusion that is deceiving and allows for foolish speculation. A statement released said that Harry Style did not spit on Chris Pine.</p><p>Harry joked about the incident during one of his love on-tour shows at Madison Square Garden as he told the crowd,</p><p>“It’s wonderful, wonderful, wonderful to be back in Newyork. I just popped very quickly to Venice to spit on Chris Pike.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Malala-at-Oscars-2023-jpg.webp><p>So, No, Harry did not spit on anyone, but Jimmy Kimmel thought it was appropriate to ask Malala her opinion of this at the Oscars, and she responded with the best answer,</p><p>“I only talk about peace.”</p><p>Now for those of you whose who don’t know. <a href=#>Malala</a> is a huge activist for female education and a young activist to win the Nobel peace prize.</p><h2 class="kt-adv-heading_dd7eb9-3c wp-block-kadence-advancedheading" data-kb-block=kb-adv-heading_dd7eb9-3c>Slap Jokes</h2><p>Jimmy Kimmel made about 9-10 slap <a href=# data-type=post data-id=13089 rel="noreferrer noopener">Jokes on Will Smith</a> without mentioning his name. But, of course, we all know about the scene that happened at the Oscars last year.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Will-Smith-slapped-Chris-Rock-at-Oscars-2022-jpg.webp><p>Will Smith slapped Chris Rock when he made a joke about his wife, Jada Pinkett Smith. he reached out to the stage and slapped him. As a result, he got banned from the Oscars for ten years.</p><p>Well, the slap jokes are boring now. We need something new, Hollywood.</p><h2 class="kt-adv-heading_7a2ea7-7f wp-block-kadence-advancedheading" data-kb-block=kb-adv-heading_7a2ea7-7f>Jamie Lee Curtis win</h2><p>Many people were upset with <a href=#>Jamie Lee Curtis</a> winning an Oscar for best actress in a supporting role. It’s not like she didn’t deserve it, but people think other nominees deserved it more, like Angela Bassett or Stephane Hsu.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Jamie-Lee-Curtis-won-the-Oscar-for-best-actress-in-a-supporting-role-jpg.webp><p>There was disappointment that a white woman won over women of color. Many people also didn’t think it was fair since Jamie has such a small role in the film, Everything Everywhere All at once, while Stephanie, who was also in the movie, had a bigger, more critical role and needed to be recognized in it.</p><h2 class="kt-adv-heading_20b3fd-c5 wp-block-kadence-advancedheading" data-kb-block=kb-adv-heading_20b3fd-c5>Angela Bassett is a sore loser</h2><p class=has--font-size><a href=#>Angela Bassett</a> was nominated for the best actress in a supporting role for Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, but Jamie lee Curtis won instead. This drew gasps from the crowd because Angela was considered the front-runner. While many are happy for Jamie, many also express their sadness for</p><p class=has--font-size>Angela, who was in a similar position in 1992. But then, she was nominated for best actress for her role as Tina Turner in the biopic, What’s love got to do with it but was beaten by Holly Hunter, the star of the piano.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Angela-Bassett-at-Oscars-2023-jpg.webp><p class=has--font-size>Although Angela’s fans praise her despite her underwhelmed reaction to the announcement, as Jamie celebrated her win, an emotional Angela kept a blank look on her face. People on Twitter gathered to show their Support for Angela, saying,</p><p class=has--font-size>“Angela Bassett’s reaction was for real. This Woman has given so much to all of her films for the Oscars to drop her yet again.”</p><p class=has--font-size>Although many supported her, many thought she was rude and a sore loser.</p><h2 class="kt-adv-heading_beb2a4-c3 wp-block-kadence-advancedheading" data-kb-block=kb-adv-heading_beb2a4-c3>Ruth E Carter became the First black lady to win multiple Oscars.</h2><p class=has--font-size><a href=#>Ruth E Carter</a> became the first black woman to win two Oscars in any category. She is an American costume designer for films and television with over 40 films in her career.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Ruth-E-Carter-became-the-First-black-lady-to-win-multiple-Oscars-jpg.webp><p class=has--font-size>She has been nominated for the academy awards for best costume designs four times and won her first oscar for the Marvel Superhero film Black Panther.</p><p class=has--font-size>She then made history again by winning the same award in the same category for the Black Panther Wakanda Forever, making her the first black woman to win multiple Oscars.</p><h2 class="kt-adv-heading_810147-be wp-block-kadence-advancedheading" data-kb-block=kb-adv-heading_810147-be>Michelle Yeoh Became The First Asian Woman to win the Oscars for Best Actress.</h2><p><a href=#>Michelle Yeoh</a> became the first Asian to win the best actress award. She is a Malaysian actress credited as Michelle Khan in her early films in Hong Kong.</p><p>In the history of Oscar, there are only two Asian women who were nominated for the best actress category; Merle Oberon was the first actress to be nominated.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Michelle-Yeoh-Became-The-First-Asian-Woman-to-win-the-Oscars-for-Best-Actress.-jpeg.webp><p>After 87 years, Michelle became the other Asian actress nominated in the same category. It was a considerable milestone to be nominated, but winning the Oscar made history. She was awarded for her lead role in the movie Everything Everywhere all at once.</p><h2 class="kt-adv-heading_874774-21 wp-block-kadence-advancedheading" data-kb-block=kb-adv-heading_874774-21>Lady Gaga made headlines at the Oscars for trying to aid a photographer who took a tumble.</h2><p>While <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Lady Gaga</a> was heading to the auditorium, a photographer behind her fell on the floor. No one but it was Gaga ran to pick the poor soul.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Lady-Gaga-made-headlines-at-the-Oscars-for-trying-to-aid-a-photographer-who-took-a-tumble.-jpg.webp><p>The camera person stood up and, in a gesture of praise, patted Gaga’s waist. It may seem innocent to a few, but it was definitely awkward. You can see the disappointment on her face.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo6%2FRoquim6NjsLC5jmpoZq2eqsC2rctmq6GhnpzAbsDHmqtmoJGlvaa6xJ1kmqxdpMCkrdGsZGtoYmh8</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./actress-gadot-who-was-miss-israel-2004-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Actress Gadot who was Miss Israel 2004">&larr;
