Who is Vasco Rossi dating now & how much money does Vasco Rossi have?</p><h2>Vasco Rossi Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Vasco Rossi</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Pop Singer</strong> who was born on <strong>February 7, 1952</strong> in Zocca, Emilia-Romagna, <strong>Italy</strong>. The singer is famous for his hit tracks “Albachiara” and “Siamo Solo Noi” and also for his 10-times Platinum album Gli Spari Sopra, this Italian composer and singer composed more than 300 songs and released more than thirty albums between 1977 and 2015.</p><p>He is a close friend of the fellow Italian pop star&nbsp;He is a contemporary of fellow Italian pop singer <a href=#>Gianni Morandi</a>…</p><p>Encouraged by his friend Gaetano Curreri (now leading member of Italian rock band Stadio), Rossi released his first EP on 13 June 1977, which included the songs “Jenny è pazza” (Jenny is crazy) and “Silvia”, and a full-length album in 1978, Ma cosa vuoi che sia una canzone (“What do you think a song is”). In 1979, he released a second album, Non siamo mica gli americani (“We’re not at all the Americans”), which included, “Albachiara” (“Cleardawn”), one of his biggest hits, a ballad considered emblematic of Rossi’s poetic style. His most controversial album, Colpa d’Alfredo (“Alfredo’s fault”) followed in 1980; its title-track was censored from the radio and let loose bitter criticism because it contained some lyrics referring to women considered too explicit at that time. The controversy actually increased Rossi’s popularity, and he quickly saw himself famous on a national level, particularly after performing live on Domenica In, a popular Italian television program. The performance did not particularly please journalist Nantas Salvalaggio, who published a scathing article against Rossi calling him a drug addict. Rossi argued that Salvalaggio evidently did not understand his music and remarked how easy it is to criticize a still unknown artist who cannot defend himself.</p><p>In 1981, the album Siamo solo noi (“It’s only us”) was released. The title track, another signature song of his, would become commonly recognized as a generational hymn.</p><p align=justify>The family was born in Zocca, Italy, to Carlo and Novella Rosso, he spent his high school as well as his early adulthood in Bologna.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=3.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Vasco Rossi</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Vasco</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Rossi</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Pop Singer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>February 7</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1952</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Zocca</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Emilia-Romagna</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Italy</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Aquarius</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Giovanni Carlo Rossi, Novella Corsi</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Laura Schmidt</strong></td></tr><tr readability=4><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Luca Rossi Schmidt, Davide Rossi, Lorenzo Rossi</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Vasco Rossi ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

The following year, he reappeared at the Sanremo Music Festival, this time performing “Vita spericolata” (Daredevil Life), probably his most popular song, and finishing in second-to-last place due to his apparent state of intoxication. The following album, Bollicine (“Little Bubbles”), published in 1983, was his sixth in seven years, and was the album that consecrated him definitively as an idol of the new generation and an icon of Italian rock. The title track, whose lyrics are about Coke (but also demonstrate a clear assonance with cocaine), won the Festivalbar ’83, and his tour that year was an enormous success.</p><p align=justify>In 1995, Rossi was again the star at San Siro with a double concert, Rock sotto l’assedio (“Rock under siege”), which protested the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
