She was born on the 16th of July 1987 in Bombay, India. Her parents have been accurately identified as Irmgard King and Michael Jaffray King.</p><p>While Michael is a British citizen, Irmgard comes from Germany, this explains why Marieangela is said to have dual citizenship of Britain and Germany, but her ethnicity is mixed.</p><h3><strong>The Popular Musician Shared her Childhood with Six Siblings</strong></h3><p>Marieangela King grew up in a large family where she shared her childhood with six siblings – three sisters and a couple of brothers. She is the first daughter and the second child. Her brother, Michael Phillip King, is the oldest. Michael, who is named after their father, was born in Prune, India, on the 2nd of March 1985, making him two years older than Marieangela.</p><p>Her second brother, David Lucius King, is younger than Marieangela by eight years and was born in Perechyn, Ukraine, on the 3rd of February 1995. The girls in the King family include Jasmina King, who was born in Bombay, India, on the 19th of February 1990. On the other hand, Natalia King was born in Uzhgorod, Ukraine, on the 7th of May 1992. There are also Michele and Jemima, who are the latest addition to the family.</p><p>On her educational background, Marieangela didn’t school in the conventional educational system. Perhaps, because the King family doesn’t stay long in one country, their parents decided to educate the children the homeschooling way. Besides, homeschooling seemed to be the only option for the King children as their band activities took them all over the globe.</p><h3><strong>She’s Both Multi-cultural and Multi-lingual</strong></h3><p>The places of birth for the King’s children is an indication that the family is widely traveled. Thus, Marieangela King and her siblings enjoyed an adventurous and fun-filled childhood, having to grow up shuttling from one country to another. Queeny, as she is fondly called, says is said to have touched down in 30 different; littles, little wonder she is multilingual with the capacity to speak four different languages.</p><p>The singer’s globe-trotting has made her a veritable citizen of the world. She has competence in languages like English (since her dad is a British man), Hindu (This is because India is her place of birth, where the singer spent her early years), and Dutch (learned from her mum’s side of the family).</p><h2><strong>Marieangela was a Member of Her Family Band, The King Family Band</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/02/Marieangela-King-with-her-band-members-e1645821466316.jpg><p>As they came of age, Marieangela King and her siblings joined efforts in 1997 to launch a music group known as King Family. The hip-hop/ pop group consists of Michael King, whose stage name is Trillion; Marieangela, also known as Queeny; Jasmine performs under the moniker, Jazzy; Natalie is called Ruby; and their second brother, David, is known as Lucius.</p><p>The youngsters began writing and producing songs in no time at all.&nbsp;By 1998, the King children were already making a name in the music industry, catching the attention of a music imprint that offered them a recording deal worth the sum of $4 million.</p><p>Though this opportunity was deemed too good to lose, their parents had to step in to refuse the offer on behalf of the children. According to reports, their reason was that the children were still minors and cannot commit to a full–time music career with its demands. With that said, the King family music group continued to perform on radio and television, including shows.</p><h3><strong>The King Family Music Group In Later Years</strong></h3><p>The King Family music group has been performing for over a decade when they finally inked a deal with the German-based EMI Capitol Records. In 2008, the debut single, Carry Me Home, hit the music stand with a big bang, and within a very short while, it hit no.1 on the German Music charts. Their second single, Perfect Day, was also a chart-topper.</p><p>Three months down the line, the group assembled their debut album, which was also called Carry Me Home.&nbsp;Marieangela King and her siblings stayed with EMI for over a year before they parted ways. Following this, they changed the group’s name to “KING” and eventually relocated to the United States to pursue a music career.</p><p>Their decision to relocate to America was appreciated by many, including Doc McGhee – the popular American music manager.&nbsp;We watched The “KING” music group’s journey to stardom in Goodbye Deutschland! Die Auswanderer series on the German television channel known as VOX. “KING” has maintained a united front to date.</p><p>However, a time came when Ruby and Jazzy decided to break away from the family group, forming their own music group under the moniker Blonde Electra.&nbsp;Following the exit of the two, Jemima, who wasn’t previously part of “KING,” came in to replace her departing sisters.</p><h3><strong>Did Marieangela King Have A Solo Career</strong></h3><p>There was no record of any solo career for Marieangela King for a long time. Still, after the family of singers landed in the United States, they successfully collaborated with some big wigs in the music industry, such as Glen Ballard, Mitch Allan, Bonnie McKee, Justin Trugman, and Jon Ingoldsby.</p><p>This was when the video entitled “B.O.M.B” was released under the watch of Nicholaus Goossen, who functioned as its director. This milestone gave “KING” additional exposure and popularity. Queeny later took to her Instagram handle to announce the release of her song, Make Me Baby.</p><p>Marieangela has been appearing in a lot of shows and concerts lately.</p><h2><strong>Marieangela King Met Elijah Blue Allman through a Blind Date</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/02/Marieangela-King-with-her-husband-e1645880094571.jpg><p>When Marieangela King agreed to go on a blind date in 2013, little did she know that fate and providence had a lifelong spouse in store for her. Her date, Elijah Blue Allman, wasn’t expecting to find a wife that day, but that singular date changed his love life forever. Elijah, who is also a strong force in the music industry, swept Marieangela off her feet, and their love advanced rapidly.</p><p>The exact time in 2013 when their first meeting occurred was never stated, but by the time November came around, the lovebirds were already an engaged couple; this occurred on the 25th. The fact that Elijah, who has seen his fair share of girlfriends, decided to settle down with one woman baffled fans. In fact, the music star has been sowing his wild oats since he became an adult, going through celebs like Bijou Phillips, Kate Hudson, Heather Graham, and Paris Hilton with the speed of lightning.</p><h3><strong>The Couple Tied the Knot in December 2013</strong></h3><p>When Marieangela King and Elijah pledged their forever commitment to each other, five days after they became engaged, it shocked the world. The duo actually eloped to get married, and on the 1st of December, 2013, they stood in front of the fireplace in Elijah’s Beverly Hills home, saying, “I do.”</p><p>Talking about their nuptials, Marieangela said their elopement was comparable to the experience of Romeo and Juliet, and their exchange of vows was a closed ceremony. The occasion was graced by a few guests; most notable among them was Mickey Avalon – an American rapper who is a close friend of the couple.</p><p>The duo’s marriage has endured for eight long years and is still counting, which is yet another shocker for the people who know Elijah as a man full of many troubles. He was once enmeshed with substance abuse, and it took a great deal for the singer to get his life back on track. Needless to say, Marieangela’s marriage to Elijah Blue Allman took her to another level of fame, especially when you consider who his parents are and his track record in the world of showbiz.</p><h3><strong>Who is Marieangela King’s Husband, Elijah Blue Allman?</strong></h3><p>Elijah Blue Allman, known professionally as P. Exeter Blue, is an American musician born on <span class="LrzXr kno-fv wHYlTd z8gr9e">July 10, 1976, in Beverly Hills, California, United States. He is the lead vocalist, guitarist and lyricist of the&nbsp;industrial metal&nbsp;band&nbsp;Deadsy.</span></p><p><span class="LrzXr kno-fv wHYlTd z8gr9e">Elijah Blue Allman owes his worldwide popularity to his mum, Cher, who is known as the goddess of pop, but the young man can also hold his own in the world of music as a vocalist. His father, Gregg Allman, is also a known artist.</span></p><p>Considering his family background, it is no surprise that his career started at a very young age. Also known by his stage name, P. Exeter Blue, Elijah is currently with the rock band, Deadsy as a vocalist but doubles as a guitarist.</p><h3><strong>Marieangela King Is Said To Be The Best Thing That Ever Happened To Elijah</strong></h3><p>There was a time in the life of P. Exeter Blue when it appeared like his world was crumbling. He was a heroin and soon started experimenting with other hard substances. As if that was not enough, the instrumentalist and vocalist was also battling Lyme disease at the same time. In fact, he had a basketful of bad experiences going on in his life as of then.</p><p>He later went to look for a cure for his condition and try to get clean from heroin, but in the midst of the bad experiences, he encountered the woman who would be his wife, Marieangela. Elijah has remained grateful for meeting the love of his life with whom he has found marital bliss.</p><p>According to the Deadsy singer, he considers his wife to be the best thing that ever happened to him.&nbsp;The duo is so compatible, and their lives are connected in so many ways. According to a report, Elijah’s record label, Trankilo, has even signed on KING music group.</p><h2><strong>What Happened Between Cher and Elijah Blue Allman?</strong></h2><p>Before Marieangela King came on the scene, the queen of pop, Cher, had always been at loggerheads with her son, Elijah. She was even more irked when he eloped to marry Marieangela without pre-informing her. Angered by the duo’s impudence, she refused to give her blessings to their union and has continued to deliberately exempt them from the family’s Christmas/Thanksgiving.</p><p>Talking about his elopement with Marieangela, Elijah said he was not ready to wait for anybody’s approval or congratulations, just like he had never waited for that his whole life. The Deadsy vocalist said how he eloped to get married is the same way he has done every other thing in his life and doesn’t know any other way. He and his wife just knew the time was right for them to make a move.</p><p>Speaking further, he narrated how he has always been viewed as the black sheep of the Allman family, and the reason is that his mentality and value system are different from his family, which always results in clashes, culminating in ups and downs.&nbsp;With that said, we must also note that Cher seems to be relenting on her previous stand of keeping Elijah and his wife off their family affairs.</p><p>In a recent interview, the queen of pop revealed her desire to have grandchildren from Elijah’s marriage with Marieangela King, and her views about her daughter-in-law also seem to be shifting. Reports said family and well-wishers already have plans underway to reunite Cher and Elijah.</p><h2><strong>Scandals and Controversies</strong></h2><p>Elijah Blue Allman made news headlines in early 2014 when he opened up about the sour relationship between him and his mother, Cher, as a result of his marriage to Marieangela ‘Angie’ King. Elijah and Marieangela lived with Cher in her Malibu compound for a short while before they got married, but later moved out as the situation became tense.</p><p>Elijah, who does not wait for someone’s approval to do whatever he want to do, decided to elope with Marieangela after his mother failed to congratulate him following their engagement. When they eventually tied the knot, they chose not to invite Cher. In turn, Cher decided not to invite them to the family Christmas celebration at her house, and this gave rise to an angry twitter rant on Elijah’s part.</p><p>Stating that he and his mother have a history of not talking, Elijah disclosed that they did not talk for several years after he established his band. He also said their relationship got strained after he was sent to boarding school at age seven, and further disclosed that his mother even punished him once by sending him to a military school.</p><p>Speaking of his childhood, Elijah said he started taking drugs when he was 11 years old. In the years that followed, during his struggle with drug addiction, he suffered life-threatening overdose numerous times and had to go through rehab. He also alleged that his mother did not take it seriously when he was diagnosed with Lyme disease in 2007.</p><p>Most recently, Marieangela King, who’s currently in the process of getting divorced from Elijah Blue Allman, alleged in court documents that Cher orchestrated the alleged abduction of her son Elijah Blue Allman. Elijah filed for divorce from King in November 2021. However, during an attempt to mend their relationship on their anniversary about one year later, Marieangela claimed in court documents filed in December that four men came to the hotel room where they were staying and “removed [Allman] from our room.”</p><p>According to her, one of the men told her that they were “hired by [Allman’s] mother,” Cher, for an alleged intervention. Still in the December court documents, which she filed over payment of spousal support, Marieangela claimed she was “currently unaware” of Allman’s well-being or whereabouts.</p><h3><strong>Does Marieangela Have Kids?</strong></h3><p>Though the couple’s union is slowing inching towards the first decade, they don’t seem to have any kids. So far, Marieangela and her husband Elijah have never talked about becoming parents. The lovebirds have been making several appearances in public but have never been spotted with children. Perhaps Cher’s call for grandchildren may make a difference; time will tell.</p><h3><strong>Marieangela King’s Height and Weight</strong></h3><p>Marieangenla is not very tall at 5 feet 5 inches or 165 cm, but she is still slim and elegant at 55 Kg of body mass, approximately 121 lbs. The KING music group singer has general body statistics of 34-28-39 inches broken down as 34 for bust or bra cup, 28 for waist, and 39 for the hip.</p><p>Reports said she is blond but has often been spotted in short black hair. Her eyes are dark brown, and she wears a shoe size of 5 US.</p><h2><strong>FAQs</strong></h2><h3><strong>Who is Marieangela King?</strong></h3><p>Marieangela King is the wife of Elijah Blue Allman, the American singer, guitarist and artist.
