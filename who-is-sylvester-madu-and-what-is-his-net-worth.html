Some media reports have it that the 48-year-old actor now preaches the gospel as a pastor of a Christ Embassy Church located on Eric Moore Road in Surulere, Lagos State. The revelation of his new status came after he was rescued from a lethal car crash in 2021.</p><p>While speculations about Madu’s new profession linger, his social media account still shows that he is pretty much involved in movie-making.
